## Plugged. 


Plugged is a RESTful API for a messaging app. Not released yet but
under avtive development.


## Installation

Download the .zip of the project and extract it.

Go to the directory via your terminal of choice and run - 

```
sudo npm install
```

This will install all the required modules of the service.

I assume you have **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. If you don't
then you just need to install Node.js and npm comes with it.


After the modules are installed make sure **node_modules** directory is created in your current dir. 

The last step is to run the server -   

```
./bin/www
```

This will start the server on your localhost at port number 3000. 

```
localhost:3000
```

You're all set.


## API Reference

Coming Soon...

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
