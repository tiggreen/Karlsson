{"name":"Plugged","tagline":"Express.js based API for a messaging app. ","body":"## Plugged. \r\n\r\nPlugged is a RESTful API for a messaging app. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the .zip of the project and extract it.\r\n\r\nGo to the directory via your terminal of choice and run - \r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install all the required modules of the service.\r\n\r\nI assume you have **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. If you don't\r\nthen you just need to install Node.js and npm comes with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the modules are installed make sure **node_modules** directory is created in your current dir. \r\n\r\nThe last step is to run the server -   \r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/www\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start the server on your localhost at port number 3000. \r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalhost:3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're all set.\r\n\r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\nComing Soon...\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nDescribe and show how to run the tests with code examples.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nLet people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
